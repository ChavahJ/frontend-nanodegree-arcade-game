Help the Princess Avoid the Bugs

WARNING: This game is very boring.  There is no score. There are no sounds. There is no objective. The princess must avoid the bugs, get to the water, and then start over again.

Instructions:

Move the princess up (), down (), left (), and right ().

She needs to get to the water. Why? I don't know. She just needs it.

She also must avoid the bugs. Why? Because she doesn't like bugs.

If she hits a bug, she freaks out and jumps back to her starting point.
